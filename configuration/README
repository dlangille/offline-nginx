You can rediredt all queries here.  All responses are 
503 Service Unavailable.  That should let people and spiders
know to try again later.

To use this, here is the outline of the steps you need to perform:

1 - remove the virtual host of your real website from the Nginx configuration.
2 - add this virtual host, ensuring that you specify the right
    ServerName or ServerAlias for the host you are taking offline.
3 - restart Nginx

Enjoy.
